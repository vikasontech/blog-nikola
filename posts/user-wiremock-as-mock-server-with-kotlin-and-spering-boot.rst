**Introduction**
*****************


WireMock is a library for stubbing and mocking web services. It constructs a HTTP server that we could connect to as we would to an actual web service.

When a WireMock server is in action, we can set up expectations, call the service, and then verify its behaviors.

**Dependencies**

**Create mock server**
